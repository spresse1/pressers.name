Lots here is beautiful, and my cell phone camera just didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be cutting it. So I bought a camera &amp;ndash; a (used) Canon G5 X. The photos at the top and bottom of this post are a couple I&amp;rsquo;m proud of.
Of course, using a real camera means using real photo editing software. I run Linux on my laptop.

The public transit here is amazing, and in 7 months of living here, I haven&amp;rsquo;t once wished I had a car. But there are some things one can&amp;rsquo;t do by public transit (like moving furniture or appliances). I will eventually have to do those and would like to have the flexibility to drive if needed. So I want to keep my ability to drive, which means converting my US license to a German one.</description></item><item><title>I'm moving to Germany!</title><link>https://pressers.name/2021/02/08/im-moving-germany/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 21:52:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2021/02/08/im-moving-germany/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m moving to Germany in March! I took a position as a researcher at HLRS (in Stuttgart, Germany), where I&amp;rsquo;ll be working primarily on SODALITE.
I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about this for a number of reasons. The largest is simply that I miss being in a research environment. I miss being around people thinking about big problems in a variety of ways, just for the fun of thinking about them. Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve published two papers, been issued a patent, and spoken at three conferences.</description></item><item><title>I Finally Finished King's Quest 6!</title><link>https://pressers.name/2021/01/23/i-finally-finished-kings-quest-6/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2021 04:14:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2021/01/23/i-finally-finished-kings-quest-6/</guid><description>Well, tonight, I did it.

My laptop primarily runs linux. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few reasons to run Windows - gaming being one of them, watching streaming SilverLight video (choughnetflixcough) another. Rebooting a machine every time I want to switch operating systems is rather a drag. However, for some things (gaming), I&amp;rsquo;ll want to be doing this anyway. So I figured out how to make Windows both bare-metal boot and VM boot.

AFS has a global, DNS-based address space. It also has a ton of nice features with respect to allowing users to create and control their own groups and much more granular permissions. All in all it seems to be a good way to get data into a cluster and to allow users to store and manage documents in a reliable format.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM Cluster, part 11f: ZFS on Linux</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/12/16/building-acm-cluster-part-11f-zfs-linux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2012 23:59:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/12/16/building-acm-cluster-part-11f-zfs-linux/</guid><description>ZFSÂ is one of those pieces of software that is almost frighteningly good at what it does.

These include: deduplication, compression, data integrityÂ guaranteesÂ (ZFS can detect and repair silent data corruption), copy-on-write architecture and a built in concept of RAID. The only problem is that the source is under a licenseÂ incompatibleÂ with the linux kernel, so it will never be kernel mainline.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM Cluster, Part 11e: Building Ceph</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/12/16/building-acm-cluster-part-11e-building-ceph/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2012 16:32:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/12/16/building-acm-cluster-part-11e-building-ceph/</guid><description>Ceph is a distributed storage engine. It can be used in a whole number of different ways - for example, as a block device or an object store. The current version is codenamed argonaut, hence the header image.
In the ACM cluster, we&amp;rsquo;re using it as the storage engine for VMs. This makes a lot of sense in our case, as the VMs are going to want to move from machine to machine and this stops them having to copy the disk image.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM Cluster, Part 11d: Building Myricom fiber RPMs</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/12/16/building-myricom-fiber-rpms/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2012 05:49:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/12/16/building-myricom-fiber-rpms/</guid><description>Welcome back to my ongoing series on building the JHUACM VM cluster. In this part, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be focusing on building the RPM driver for the Myricom fiber cards that were given to us with the cluster. Unfortunately the drivers for this are closed source.

Xen was chosen because on machines which do not have virtualization bits (like the cluster I&amp;rsquo;m building), Xen will do paravirtualization, which is still somewhat quick.Xen also has the concept of clustering and shifting VMs between instances - an important feature in a VM cluster!

CentOS decided that they were going to put their weight behind QEMU/KVM as the virtulization solution and thus stopped distributing and supporting Xen.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM Cluster, Part 11b: Kernel RPM Build</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/12/16/building-acm-cluster-part-11b-kernel-rpm-build/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2012 04:11:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/12/16/building-acm-cluster-part-11b-kernel-rpm-build/</guid><description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already done so, read and executeÂ Building the ACM Cluster, Part 11a: Setting up rpmbuild environment.
This article will be covering building a new kernel for CentOS and injecting it into xCat&amp;rsquo;s local package repository. I am covering this because later on we&amp;rsquo;ll need to have a more recent kernel than CentOS comes with by default. Xen specifically requires a later kernel. However, when we build kernel modules, we&amp;rsquo;ll want to be building against the same kernel version we&amp;rsquo;re running.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM Cluster, Part 11a: Setting up rpmbuild environment</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/12/15/building-acm-cluster-part-11a-setting-rpmbuild-environment/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2012 20:14:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/12/15/building-acm-cluster-part-11a-setting-rpmbuild-environment/</guid><description>Up to this point, we haven&amp;rsquo;t built any custom software for the cluster. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried very hard to use mostly off the shelf software. However, this has to change. Several of the major components we&amp;rsquo;re going to use (xen, the fiber card driver, ceph) are not available in the CentOS repositories (or are too old). So we&amp;rsquo;re going to build them ourselves.
However, rather than build them on a node-by node basis (which would make a single install hours long&amp;hellip;), we&amp;rsquo;re going to build packages.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM VM Cluster, Part 10: Operating system image build</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/12/15/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-8-operating-system-image-build/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2012 18:40:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/12/15/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-8-operating-system-image-build/</guid><description>Now that we&amp;rsquo;re done with network configuration.

Lets go ISO Huntin'! The first step in building operating system install images is to get the full operating system images. Not netboot, but a fully installable version. For CentOS the mirrors pageÂ is a good place to start your hunt. Personally, I downloaded both DVD images (CentOS-6.3-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso and CentOS-6.3-x86_64-bin-DVD2.iso), though I suspect that simply the minimal image will cover it.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM Cluster, Part 9: Setting up masquerade with iptables</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/12/15/building-acm-cluster-part-8-setting-masquerade-iptables/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2012 18:22:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/12/15/building-acm-cluster-part-8-setting-masquerade-iptables/</guid><description>Alright!

Right now, the nodes inside the cluster can&amp;rsquo;t speak to the outside world. While we set up the head node to be able to speak to things on every interface, we haven&amp;rsquo;t yet told it how to move traffic from one interface to another.

However, it is really generic systems stuff and not terribly related to the actual cluster build. It is much more closely related to quirks of JHU networking.)

Timers and sockets and protocols! (Oh my!)). However, a friend of mine posted a link on G+ I thought was really cool and wanted to share.
So without further ado: Throwing one&amp;rsquo;s voice 95 miles on a lightbeam - from KA7OEI.
As a techie and ham myself, I think this is really cool. It gets you into all sorts of things you don&amp;rsquo;t usually have to think about - earth&amp;rsquo;s geometry, atmospheric attenuation of light, and data encodings, to name a few.</description></item><item><title>Site Design</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/09/18/site-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2012 00:05:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/09/18/site-design/</guid><description>Thanks to my very talented friend Kyle M., I now have a site design! I rather like it, but please do let me know if you find things that don&amp;rsquo;t render properly or any other issues.
And many many thanks to Kyle for producing something better than anything I could ever hope to make.</description></item><item><title>Configuring Cisco 2900XL Switches via TFTP (and alongside xCat)</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/09/11/configuring-cisco-2900xl-switches-tftp-and-alongside-xcat/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 01:36:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/09/11/configuring-cisco-2900xl-switches-tftp-and-alongside-xcat/</guid><description>As part of my ACM cluster creation obsession, I wanted to make the Cisco 2900XL switches we have autoconfigure. I&amp;rsquo;m not terribly familiar with how these switches operate and, rather than reconfigure all of them at once, I&amp;rsquo;d much rather be able to reboot (reload, in cisco parlence) them and have them come up with my new, clean config.
Fortunately for me, Cisco thought of a situation like this when building the software for these switches.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM Cluster, Part 6: Network Configuration</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/09/09/building-acm-cluster-part-6-network-configuration/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2012 21:51:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/09/09/building-acm-cluster-part-6-network-configuration/</guid><description>In part 5 of this series, I covered the generic xCat setup and we told it how the network was set up. We&amp;rsquo;ve done little bits of network setup before (like setting our switches up for SNMP read access in the public community). Now we&amp;rsquo;re going to do quite a bit more.
Telling xCat where Nodes Are xCat has this wonderful ability to know what a newly plugged in machine is, based on where it is on a switch.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM VM Cluster, Part 5: xCat configuration</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/09/09/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-5-xcat-configuration/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2012 19:41:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/09/09/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-5-xcat-configuration/</guid><description>In part 4 of this series, we installed xCat. Now its time to configure it.
But First&amp;hellip; But first, lets talk a little about how you interact with xCat. xCat stores its configuration files in &amp;ldquo;tab&amp;quot;s - tables. In the default case, these are sqlite tables, though some will try to convince you to change it to MySQL. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re running thousands of nodes or continually hitting xCat, I see no point in this changeover and therefore will not cover it.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM VM Cluster, Part 4: xCat Install</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/09/09/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-4-xcat-install/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2012 13:19:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/09/09/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-4-xcat-install/</guid><description>In part 3 of this series, we got the management node set up to route traffic and generally properly configured. Now its time to actually install xCat!
Choices Many xCat guides recommend downloading the RPMs and manually installing those. The benefit of this route is that you need no networkÂ connectionÂ to your management node for this setup. However, I prefer to have a simple upgrade path. I also know my cluster will continuously be connected to the internet, so I don&amp;rsquo;t need an offline configuration.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM VM Cluster, Part 3: Mangement Node Setup - Keepalived</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/09/08/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-3-keepalived/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2012 21:45:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/09/08/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-3-keepalived/</guid><description>In part 2Â of this series, I covered the network design - the last theoretical piece of design we need. Now let&amp;rsquo;s do some practical stuff! In this section I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover base network setup and keepalived installation on the management node.
Prerequisites For this I&amp;rsquo;ve assumed you already have a set up CentOS machine. In my case, its CentOS 6.3 (64-bit) though this may of course vary, in which case, refer to the XCat documentationÂ to see any differences.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM VM Cluster, Part 2: Network design</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/09/08/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-2-network-design/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2012 21:04:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/09/08/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-2-network-design/</guid><description>Welcome to part 2 of my series of posts on building the ACM VM cluster! Part 1Â covered the hardware and software that will be used in the cluster. Part 2 is going to focus on network design.
Introduction Typically in clusters there are two networks (usually represented by IP ranges, though sometimes actually physically separate): management and work. ManagementÂ is typically mostly for master node to worker node communication (giving and getting work orders), whereas work is for intercommunication between nodes.</description></item><item><title>Building the ACM VM Cluster, Part 1: Hardware</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/09/08/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2012 19:48:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/09/08/building-acm-vm-cluster-part-1/</guid><description>So I have a vision for the ACM systems - I&amp;rsquo;d like to make it so we are as redundant as possible and we can do updates to systems without having to take them offline. The obvious answer to this is using VMs, in a cluster. Fortunately, the ACM recentlyÂ receivedÂ a donation of the old DLMS cluster from physics (as well as three more recent Dell servers from JHU Housing and Dining).</description></item><item><title>Luna: A Case-Study in Failure</title><link>https://pressers.name/2012/09/08/luna-case-study-failure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2012 17:23:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2012/09/08/luna-case-study-failure/</guid><description>I intended to make the first post here be about the technology under the site and how to set up a similar site. I will still write that one, but in the meantime a much more interesting problem has come up and I wish to share it with you.
