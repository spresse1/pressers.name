The steps I took are below. However, I&amp;rsquo;m so excited about the end product that I wanted to start by showing it off.
The Adventure Begins On a whim, I asked a friend to give me an idea for something to 3D print. She&amp;rsquo;s a huge fan of Garth Nix&amp;rsquo;s Abhorsen series and admires the Clayr.</description></item><item><title>New software - GCode splitter!</title><link>https://pressers.name/2014/03/07/new-software-gcode-splitter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2014 02:00:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2014/03/07/new-software-gcode-splitter/</guid><description>Over the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been silent as I transitioned from the life of a student to the life of a professional. But! I have finished that transition (for the most part) and am now back. I even bring new software with me.
This new software (which has the rather uncreative name &amp;ldquo;gcode splitter&amp;rdquo;) is a utility for use in 3D printing. I have acquired a 3D printer for me to experiment with.</description></item><item><title>Extruding Silhouettes for 3D Printing with Inkscape and OpenSCAD</title><link>https://pressers.name/2013/09/13/extruding-silhouettes-3d-printing-inkscape-and-openscad/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2013 23:54:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2013/09/13/extruding-silhouettes-3d-printing-inkscape-and-openscad/</guid><description>I recently found myself in a position where I wanted to extrude a logo so I could 3D print it. Unfortunately, this is a pretty difficult process to figure out without instructions. Therefore, I decided to document it. This process assumes you&amp;rsquo;re starting with a pixel-based image (bitmap, jpg, etc).

In my opinion, this is Defense Distributed getting the legal fight with the government it was spoiling for. More on that to follow.
Hello again world. How are you today? It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last posted, mostly due to school. Good news is that I had an awesome semester and worked on some very cool projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
