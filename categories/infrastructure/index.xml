And the reasons were pretty simple &amp;ndash; and dumb. This post is going to be a sort of post-mortem on why it failed and what the fixes were. And (hopefully) it&amp;rsquo;ll include some lessons learned.
About the Site This site runs on apache2 on a debian-stable server. The underlying site is written in Django. The entire site is supposed to be self-maintaining.</description></item></channel></rss>
