(I have a dedicated server for raid and file dumps. What, you don&amp;rsquo;t?). When I first set this machine up 2-3 years ago, I gave it a single HDD (yes, spinning iron!) to boot from. At the time, my rationale was &amp;ldquo;hey, if it dies, the RAID is intact, I just have to rebuild the system&amp;rdquo;. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m changing from having several home directories scattered over all my machines to keeping a unified home directory in AFS.</description></item><item><title>New software - GCode splitter!</title><link>https://pressers.name/2014/03/07/new-software-gcode-splitter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2014 02:00:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2014/03/07/new-software-gcode-splitter/</guid><description>Over the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been silent as I transitioned from the life of a student to the life of a professional.

I have acquired a 3D printer for me to experiment with.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Shrubbery: a cheap BMC-equivalent for Linux Machines</title><link>https://pressers.name/2013/01/06/introducing-shrubbery-cheap-bmc-equivalent-linux-machines/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jan 2013 01:31:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pressers.name/2013/01/06/introducing-shrubbery-cheap-bmc-equivalent-linux-machines/</guid><description>I run a little server on my apartment network for small services (an IRC bouncer, some screens, SSH and MD-Raid). However, I&amp;rsquo;m not always at the machine when I&amp;rsquo;m working on it. I have, in the past, been lucky and not taken it totally offline when doing upgrades remotely. Until this week.
Having now accidentally removed myself from all the services I usually use, I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated. In my work life, I often use servers which have Baseboard Management ControllersÂ (BMC).</description></item></channel></rss>
