In the intervening 7.5 years, some of my opinions have shifted. Some haven&amp;rsquo;t. And frankly I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about some of my textual interpretation here anymore. A post like this is best left to experts - not some 23-year-old.
I still think &amp;ldquo;hacking back&amp;rdquo; is a terrible idea, but we&amp;rsquo;ve managed not to have a cyberattack turn into a shooting war.</description></item></channel></rss>
