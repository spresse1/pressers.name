in Germany</p></header><div class=entry-body><p>I don&rsquo;t ever plan to drive in Germany. The public transit here is amazing, and in 7 months of living here, I haven&rsquo;t once wished I had a car. But there are some things one can&rsquo;t do by public transit (like moving furniture or appliances). I will eventually have to do those and would like to have the flexibility to drive if needed. So I want to keep my ability to drive, which means converting my US license to a German one.</p><p>As it turns out, Massachusetts (where I lived before moving) is one of 11 US states that have full reciprocity with Germany. That means that converting my MA license to a German one should be a matter of just some paperwork. <a href=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/fev_2010/anlage_11.html>This page</a> is the list of countries and states which can be converted into German driver&rsquo;s licenses, and whether or not the theoretical or practical tests must be done.</p><h1 id=so-how-does-one-actually-do-this>So&mldr; How does one actually do this?</h1><p>There are many articles out there promising to tell you <a href=https://www.expatica.com/de/living/transportation/how-to-get-a-german-driving-licence-100905/>step-by-step</a> how to convert a driver&rsquo;s license. Many of them have the major caveat of only promising step-by-step for Munich. A quick search through various expat forums reveals that varies by municipality and sometimes even within a municipality.</p><p>So the quick answer is: contact the local Führerscheinstelle (driver&rsquo;s license office) and ask. I&rsquo;ll be writing about what it was for me, in a city outside Stuttgart.</p><p>However, there are some ground rules true throughout Germany:</p><ul><li>You need your prior driver&rsquo;s license</li><li>Your prior driver&rsquo;s license allows you to drive in Germany for the first 6 months of your residence, and can be traded in any time in the first two (or three?) years of residence. In any case, it&rsquo;s probably best to do ASAP.</li></ul><p>And one more caveat: My experience was different and unusual because of the pandemic. I never set foot in the driver&rsquo;s license office. I did a lot of correspondence by email and postal mail.</p><h1 id=what-did-i-need-what-did-i-do>What did I need? What did I do?</h1><p>It&rsquo;s actually a pretty reasonable list:</p><ul><li>My MA driver&rsquo;s license (duh)</li><li>A translation of my MA driver&rsquo;s license</li><li>A photocopy of my passport (to identify me)</li><li>A biometric photo (for the new license)</li><li>An &ldquo;bestätigung über die erste Einreise&rdquo; (&ldquo;statement of first arrival&rdquo;). The local foreigner&rsquo;s agency provides this, and it is simply a document that states when I first took up residence in Germany. It&rsquo;s used to show that I haven&rsquo;t waited too long to convert my driver&rsquo;s license.</li><li>Roughly €100 for the translation and for fees</li></ul><p>My first step was to email my local Führerscheinstelle and tell them what I wanted to do. They asked for a photocopy of my passport, photocopy of my driver&rsquo;s license, translation of my driver&rsquo;s license, and bestätigung über die erste Einreise. Basically enough to identify me, verify I had a valid driver&rsquo;s license and verify that it could be converted.</p><p>Gathering these was honestly the hardest part of this process. The photocopies were easy enough. But the bestätigung über die erste Einreise meant a bike ride down to the local Ausländerbehörde (foreigner&rsquo;s office) and speaking German (poorly, on my part) with a very kind woman behind the desk there. But I&rsquo;m proud to say I managed and was able to do the entire transaction in German. Getting this document cost me €18.</p><p>The driver&rsquo;s license translation was more complicated. Germany has a group called ADAC which is roughly equivalent to AAA in the US. They offer <a href=https://www.adac.de/der-adac/regionalclubs/wuerttemberg/fuehrerscheinuebersetzung/>translation services</a> for driver&rsquo;s licenses. But these are costly (~€65) and take a long time (at least four weeks). Instead, I ended up going with a company called <a href=https://www.lingoking.com/en/order/translate-driving-licence#>LingoKing</a>. They turned the translation around in less than 24 hours (at a cost around €55, including extra copies of the translation) and I had a certified paper copy in my hands in about 3 days. And I submitted the order on a Saturday. It was amazingly fast.</p><p>So off goes all that data, and back comes a partly pre-filled form. This asked me for my name, address, vital information, and a biometric photo.</p><p>Back goes that form, and I next get a letter telling me that my driver&rsquo;s license has been examined, found equivalent to a German one and converted. And that they will mail it to me as soon as I send them €32.50 and my MA driver&rsquo;s license.</p><p>So I sent payment and my MA license, and a couple days later had a German driver&rsquo;s license!</p><p>Overall this process turned out to be almost painless. It took a while, but the delay was largely on my side. Nor was it overly expensive or complicated. Overall, it was a pretty pleasant experience interacting with German bureaucracy.</p></div></article></div></main></div></div><div id=sidebar><div class=widget><nav><h1>Recent Posts</h1><ul class=entries-reent><li><a href=/2022/04/03/website-hosting-changed/>Website hosting changed</a></li><li><a href=/2022/02/01/enigma-2022/>Enigma 2022</a></li><li><a href=/2021/11/21/getting-new-lenses-lensfun-notes/>Getting new lenses for Lensfun</a></li><li><a href=/2021/10/04/living-germany-converting-drivers-license/>Living in Germany: Converting a Driver's License</a></li><li><a href=/2021/02/08/im-moving-germany/>I'm moving to Germany!</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=sidebarbender></div><div class=widget><nav><h1>Social Media</h1><ul class=socialmedia><li><a href=https://twitter.com/spresser>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-presser/>LinkedIn</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=sidebarbender></div><div class=widget><nav><h1>Categories</h1><ul class=categories><li><a href=/categories/3d-printing/>3D Printing</a></li><li><a href=/categories/acm/>ACM</a></li><li><a href=/categories/acm-cluster/>ACM Cluster</a></li><li><a href=/categories/cyberlaw/>Cyberlaw</a></li><li><a href=/categories/cybersecurity/>Cybersecurity</a></li><li><a href=/categories/germany/>Germany</a></li><li><a href=/categories/infrastructure/>Infrastructure</a></li><li><a href=/categories/life-in-germany/>Life in Germany</a></li><li><a href=/categories/links/>Links</a></li><li><a href=/categories/presentations/>Presentations</a></li><li><a href=/categories/projects/>Projects</a></li><li><a href=/categories/shrubbery/>Shrubbery</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=sidebarbender></div></div></div><div id=onetracebottom><footer><a href=https://github.com/spresse1/pressers.name>Website source</a><br>Site design by Kyle M.</footer></div></div></body></html>
