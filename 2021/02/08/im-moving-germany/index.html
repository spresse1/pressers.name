in Germany</p></header><div class=entry-body><p>I&rsquo;m moving to Germany in March! I took a position as a researcher at <a href=https://www.hlrs.de/>HLRS</a> (in Stuttgart, Germany), where I&rsquo;ll be working primarily on <a href=https://www.hlrs.de/de/about-us/research/current-projects/sodalite/>SODALITE</a>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m really excited about this for a number of reasons. The largest is simply that I miss being in a research environment. I miss being around people thinking about big problems in a variety of ways, just for the fun of thinking about them. Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve published two papers, been issued a patent, and spoken at three conferences. Only one paper and one speaking event were through work and that was a rather unique opportunity. I find the process of starting with a problem and building up a novel and unique solution to be really fulfilling. If engineering is the process of building things, research is the process of proving things can be built. And it turns out I enjoy both parts and am most fulfilled when doing some of both.</p><p>This does mean leaving <a href=https://www.hpe.com/us/en/compute/hpc.html>HPE/Cray</a>. I&rsquo;ve been there six years and worked on 3 separate pieces of systems management software for supercomputers. I&rsquo;ve met and worked with really amazing people. I&rsquo;m going to miss my coworkers and I&rsquo;m going to miss the work. But this new position brings new challenges and new experiences &ndash; and space for new growth. I&rsquo;m a good engineer, a good developer and even decent at architecting software. But this new position will stretch me in a different direction &ndash; it&rsquo;s going to have a lot more communication. In addition to helping write papers, I&rsquo;m going to help write reports that go to the EU Commission. As I&rsquo;ve worked on bigger and bigger things at Cray, the more I find that communication &ndash; the ability to clearly articulate thoughts to multiple people and make sure everyone is moving toward the same goal &ndash; is critical to being able to build world-changing software. And since my goal is building world-changing software, that means I need to be the best communicator I can be.</p><p>This position also comes with the possibility of doing a PhD, after I&rsquo;ve been employed for a year. I have always wanted to do a PhD, but have not found a topic that I feel I could commit to and dive in to at the depth required for a PhD. But finding something related to work I&rsquo;m already doing (and hopefully enjoying) feels much more achievable.</p><p>One of the other parts of this I&rsquo;m looking forward to is experiencing a different culture (and getting to be part of it, I hope!). I never studied abroad in college, nor have I traveled particularly widely. I&rsquo;d like to fix that and living somewhere is certainly a way to do so!</p><p>So me, my partner, my two cats and her dog are all picking up and moving to Germany.</p><h1 id=writing-about-it>Writing about it</h1><p>I&rsquo;m going to try to write about the process and experience of moving. If nothing else, this will help me be less of a perfectionist about my writing. Prose (unlike code) can always be tweaked further and further. There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;good enough to work&rdquo;, the way there is with code. As a perfectionist, this means I often sit down to write prose and never finish it, never think it&rsquo;s good enough to send off. For the last year and a half, I&rsquo;ve kept a daily journal. That&rsquo;s helped a lot with writing paralysis. But there&rsquo;s a big difference between writing a journal for my own record and writing something that I intend others to read!</p><p>My plan is to write this in two parallel threads. First there&rsquo;s the process of preparing (before departure), And second there&rsquo;s what happens after arrival. As I sit writing this, I&rsquo;m actually mostly ready to apply for my visa and preparations for departure are reasonably well set. I&rsquo;ve got notes on what happened at various stages, but not anything written with meaningful prose. So I&rsquo;ll write that as I&rsquo;m able to catch up with it. But at the same time, I&rsquo;ll be there in Germany learning and adjusting and I don&rsquo;t wish to delay writing about that.</p><h1 id=but-theres-a-pandemic-on>But there&rsquo;s a Pandemic on!</h1><p>Yes, there is. And that&rsquo;s going to make everything more complicated. That&rsquo;s another reason to write about this. There&rsquo;s a ton of stuff online about moving to Germany. There&rsquo;s much less about moving to Germany when you can&rsquo;t merely show up at the border and be allowed entry. And there&rsquo;s next to nothing about international moves during the pandemic. This is an experience that will be unique &ndash; for better or for worse. And that makes it worth recording.</p><h1 id=so-watch-this-space>So Watch this Space</h1><p>So watch this space for more about moving to Germany! I&rsquo;m going to tag all posts about moving to Germany with &ldquo;<a href=/categories/germany/>Germany</a>&rdquo;, those about preparing with &ldquo;<a href=/categories/germany-preparations/>Germany Preparations</a>&rdquo; and those after arrival with &ldquo;<a href=/categories/life-in-germany/>Life in Germany</a>&rdquo;.</p><p>This will be an adventure and I hope my writing does it justice so you can enjoy riding along!</p></div></article></div></main></div></div><div id=sidebar><div class=widget><nav><h1>Recent Posts</h1><ul class=entries-reent><li><a href=https://pressers.name/2022/02/01/enigma-2022/>Enigma 2022</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/2021/11/21/getting-new-lenses-lensfun-notes/>Getting new lenses for Lensfun</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/2021/10/04/living-germany-converting-drivers-license/>Living in Germany: Converting a Driver's License</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/2021/02/08/im-moving-germany/>I'm moving to Germany!</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/2021/01/23/i-finally-finished-kings-quest-6/>I Finally Finished King's Quest 6!</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=sidebarbender></div><div class=widget><nav><h1>Social Media</h1><ul class=socialmedia><li><a href=https://twitter.com/spresser>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-presser/>LinkedIn</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=sidebarbender></div><div class=widget><nav><h1>Categories</h1><ul class=categories><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/3d-printing/>3D Printing</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/acm/>ACM</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/acm-cluster/>ACM Cluster</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/cyberlaw/>Cyberlaw</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/cybersecurity/>Cybersecurity</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/germany/>Germany</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/infrastructure/>Infrastructure</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/life-in-germany/>Life in Germany</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/links/>Links</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/presentations/>Presentations</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/projects/>Projects</a></li><li><a href=https://pressers.name/categories/shrubbery/>Shrubbery</a></li></ul></nav></div><div class=sidebarbender></div></div></div><div id=onetracebottom><footer><a href=https://github.com/spresse1/pressers.name>Website source</a><br>Site design by Kyle M.</footer></div></div></body></html>
