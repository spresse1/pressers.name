So.  I've been quiet lately.  I'm still working on everything I was before.  But, the semester is in full swing, so I've had exams to study for.  This weekend, however, is going to be mostly ACM stuff.  A lot of that will be cleaning (I've made a mess with all the cluster gear lying about), but if I'm lucky, I'll have a post early next week about the new network configuration for the ACM.  Especially if I can figure out how to get the switches to send well-formed DHCP requests over non-default vlans.  I might also have a writeup of getting the storage stuff built and of kickstarting nodes.  We'll see.  I'm working on the cluster on many fronts.  And sometimes one distracts me from the others.
