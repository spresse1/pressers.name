Hey world!  I've been inactive here the last month and a half because my semester got intense and I, frankly, didn't have time.  In this time, I've kept working on all my projects, job hunted and got hired.  Phew.  Busy time.

In any case, this is a "hello! still alive!" and a warning that you're probably going to see me post quite a bit here over the next few days as I catch up on my backlog of documenting things.
