Well, tonight, I did it. I finished [King's Quest 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_VI)! A feat 25 years in the making, at least for me.

I used to play this game at my grandparents', on my grandfather's computer. We'd sit for hours just poking things on the screen. It was probably 1995, we were all between 3 and 7 years old and - in the manner of children - not so much actually trying to progress in the game so much as entertaining ourselves. We probably killed poor Alexander several hundred times by having him jump into the sea. (When I told my mom I was playing the game again, that was all she recalled of the game!)

This year, after seeing an article at the wonderful [Obscuratory](https://obscuritory.com) that mentioned it ([probably this one](https://obscuritory.com/software/cooking-with-windows-recap/)), I picked up a copy. And now I've finished it, though I did miss a few points (I think I didn't save after tugging on the loose thread of the [Black Widow's web](http://www.sierrahelp.com/Misc/PointLists/KQ6Points.html)...). It holds up remarkably well and was quite fun to play, even if some of the mechanics feel a little dated. It took me a long time to realize I had to actually go find the guidebook online and that the hints from it mattered!

I may play through it again at some point (and earn all the points! Or try the shorter ending). Or try some of the rest of the series.

Long Live the Land of the Green Isles!
