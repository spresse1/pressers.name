I [appeared](https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2022/presentation/presser) at Enigma 2022 to give a talk called "Broken CAPTCHAs and Fractured Equity: Privacy and Security in hCaptcha's Accessibility Workflow". That talk came with a fair amount of accompanying material, including videos, slides, and code. That material can all be found on the [Enigma 2022 page]({{< relref "/enigma2022.md" >}}).

There will eventually be video.
