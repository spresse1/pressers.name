I did a bunch of public speaking this year. I have finally got all the material
here on my website and the various conferences have released the video. So,
here's updates from all my speaking this year.

# IEEE Cluster HPCMASPA

I presented the 
[first work towards my PhD]({{< relref "/publications/ieee_cluster_2022_hpcmaspa.md" >}})
at the [HPCMASPA workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/hpcmaspa2022) of 
[IEEE Cluster](https://clustercomp.org/2022/). Slides and preprint paper are
online. No video was made, so no video will be uploaded.

# A New HOPE

[HOPE](https://hope.net) is always a favorite of mine to attend and this year I
got to present! I 
[presented a significantly revised and extended version]({{< relref "/publications/anewhope.md" >}})
of my hCaptcha work. Video, slides, and FAQ are now online.

# Enigma 2022

Way back in January, I gave a first talk on hCaptcha at 
[Enigma 2022](https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2022). The video of this
went up a couple months ago and I missed it. It's now been added to 
[the page for that appearance]({{< relref "/publications/enigma2022.md" >}}).
