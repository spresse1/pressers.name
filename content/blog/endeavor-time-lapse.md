Hey everyone!  It's been a bit of a lazy weekend - I've mostly been doing schoolwork.  I had some success with JHUACM cluster stuff that I haven't written up yet (its fun!  I rewrote the spec file for building RPMs of a proprietary driver!).  However, I've come across a cool video to share.

# Time Lapse: Endeavor's Trip Through LA

In case you missed it, the space shuttle Endeavor recently moved off to it's new home in the California Science Center.  [The LA Times' Brian Chan put together a time-lapse video of the move](http://framework.latimes.com/2012/10/15/time-lapse-video-space-shuttle-endeavours-trek-across-l-a/).  For your convenience, its embedded below:

What struck me most about this video is the meticulous amount of planning that must have gone into this move.  Everything from the devices the shuttle is resting on to having precisely measured the streets and the trees and making sure that there would be space.  Throughout this time lapse the shuttle's movements look choreographed, perfectly planned for this route.  They even managed to plan for some obstacles being at different heights - watch closely, because at one point the shuttle is raised so that its wing *juuuusut* fits through the bend in a tree.  All in all, quite impressive and I wish I'd been able to see some of this in person.
