Not much to say today - I'm busy working on a project for class (Its fun!  Timers and sockets and protocols! (Oh my!)).  However, a friend of mine posted a link on G+ I thought was really cool and wanted to share.

So without further ado: [Throwing one's voice 95 miles on a lightbeam - from KA7OEI](http://ka7oei.blogspot.com/2012/09/throwing-ones-voice-95-miles-on.html).

As a techie and ham myself, I think this is really cool.  It gets you into all sorts of things you don't usually have to think about - earth's geometry, atmospheric attenuation of light, and data encodings, to name a few.  I don't actually know anything about the technology involved, but I thought this would be worth sharing just for the wow factor.
