This page contains resources related to my July 22nd, 2022 talk officially called "[hCaptcha: Profits over People and Fscking Useless
](https://scheduler.hope.net/new-hope/talk/U9EZLT/)". Due to new information I got after the deadline for changes, the talk I actually gave I titled "Is the CAPTCHA dead?".

Each section of this page begins with a level 2 header.

## External Resources on Accessibility Technology and Software Accessibility {id="external_resources"}

Want to learn more about accessibility technology? These pages are organized approximately from least to most technical. I've tried to focus on resources by people with disabilities, or at least recommended by them.

There are many excellent resources out there. If I've missed a good one, please let me know, either [by email](mailto:anewhope@pressers.name) or [via the contact form](/contact).

*   [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) covers web accessibility from the basics ([introduction to web accessibility](https://webaim.org/intro/), [disability types and design considerations](https://webaim.org/articles/#usersperspective), [evaluation guides](https://webaim.org/articles/evaluationguide/)) through intermediate topics ([ARIA roles](https://webaim.org/techniques/aria/), [JavaScript](https://webaim.org/techniques/javascript/) and [CSS](https://webaim.org/techniques/css/), [content specifically for users of assistive technology](https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent)) and many references to where more information may be found.
*   And, of course, the W3C, which writes the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), the standard for web accessibility and [ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/), which allows annotation of elements by role on the page, if needed. These are written and maintained by the [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/), which also hosts an excellent [introduction to accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/).

## Code

All [the code for the vulnerability](https://github.com/spresse1/handicaptcha) can be found on my GitHub account.

## Video

*   [Screenreader demo (without visuals)](https://youtu.be/RFj9N_Vnn64) - a short task performed by a screenreader user, with no visuals.
*   [Screenreader demo (with visuals)](https://youtu.be/FMpJhxVawgA) - the same short task performed by a screenreader user, with visuals.
*   [Slides hCaptcha Bypass Demo](https://youtu.be/pgEr_mU7kC0) - the shortened version of the hCaptcha bypass demo embedded in my slides.
*   [hCaptcha Full Bypass Demo Video](https://youtu.be/kmh9FFuXNVg) - this is the demo video that was sent with the responsible disclosure report. I consider it very boring and cant imagine why you'd want to watch it, but it's here anyway.
