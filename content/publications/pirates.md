Mike Walsh and I took part in a panel on surveillance at 
[PirateCon 2017](https://masspirates.org/blog/conference/2017-conference/), 
the annual gathering of the 
[Massachusetts Pirate Party](https://masspirates.org/). We talked about our 
work for [ThawAmerica](https://thawamerica.org/) on the 
[FISCR 16-01](https://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/docket/16-01) decision.
