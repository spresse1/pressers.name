I gave [a talk](https://scheduler.hope.net/new-hope/talk/U9EZLT/) at [A New HOPE](https://xiv.hope.net/) on
the privacy and security of hCaptcha, a commercial captcha product. This talk was officially called 
"[hCaptcha: Profits over People and Fscking Useless](https://scheduler.hope.net/new-hope/talk/U9EZLT/)".
Due to new information I got after the deadline for changes, the talk I actually gave I titled "Is the CAPTCHA dead?".

The slides, relevant video, FAQs and other materials are online on 
[a dedicated page]({{< relref "/anewhope.md" >}}).
