Part of my work for [Thaw America](https://thawamerica.org/) was proving that
it was possible to extract Post Cut-Through Dialing Digits (PCTDD) from phone
calls without extracting other dialing. In short, to tell a phone number from
not-a-phone-number.

This patent outlines the method I created for to do that.
