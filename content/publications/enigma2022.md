I gave [a talk](https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2022/presentation/presser) at [Enigma 2022](https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2022) on
the privacy and security of hCaptcha, a commercial captcha product.

The slides, relevant video, FAQs and other materials are online on 
[a dedicated page]({{< relref "/enigma2022.md" >}}).

Video will be added here as soon as it is posted.
