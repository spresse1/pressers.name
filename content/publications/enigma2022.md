I gave [a talk](https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2022/presentation/presser) at [Enigma 2022](https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2022) on
the privacy and security of hCaptcha, a commercial captcha product.

The slides, relevant video, FAQs and other materials are online on 
[a dedicated page]({{< relref "/enigma2022.md" >}}).

Video of the talk is [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM16M1Rc87Q) or embedded below.
