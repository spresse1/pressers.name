title: "Towards Real-Time Classification of HPC
Workloads via Out-of-band Telemetry"

This paper describes the first work done towards my PhD. In it, I show that out
of band data avilable via Redfish may be sufficient to perform classification on
HPC workloads -- in real time. This has important applications in security -- 
specifically around detecting malicious workloads and misuse of HPC systems.

I presented the paper at the 
[HPCMASPA Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/hpcmaspa2022) at 
[IEEE Cluster 2022](https://clustercomp.org/2022/). The slides
I used are avilable as 
[odp](/static/slidesets/Presser_IEEE_Cluster_HPCMASPA.odp), 
[pptx](/static/slidesets/Presser_IEEE_Cluster_HPCMASPA.pptx), or 
[pdf](/static/slidesets/Presser_IEEE_Cluster_HPCMASPA.pdf).

Code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/spresse1/realtime_hpc_classification).
